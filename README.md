# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jaqi Gates.

I've been working in the legal field for the past 6 years. I plan to utilize the skills and strengths I've gained from my previous work experience, such as logic, problem solving, and attention to detail, to thrive in my career as a full-stack software developer. I have recently earned a Udacity Nanodegree in Programming which has been a fantastic resource in learning HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, the Document Object Model (DOM), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Git, GitHub, and Unix shell. Iâ€™m grateful to Udacity for the skills they taught me and grateful to Accenture for the opportunities their Nanodegree scholarship provided. Iâ€™m excited to continue honing my skills and look forward to showing people what I can accomplish.
