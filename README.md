# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jaqi Gates.

I've been working in the legal field for the past 6 years.

I'm currently pursuing a Nanodegree in Programming with Udacity which has been a fantastic resource in learning HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, BASH, and Python3. I'm excited to continue honing my skills and look forward to showing people what I can accomplish.
