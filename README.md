# About Me
👋 Hi, I’m Jaqi Gates.

I've been working in the legal field for the past 6 years. I plan to utilize the skills and strengths I've gained from my previous work experience, such as logic, problem solving, and attention to detail, to thrive in my career as a full-stack web developer.

I'm excited to continue honing my skills and look forward to showing people what I can accomplish.
